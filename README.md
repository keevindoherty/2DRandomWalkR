2DRandomWalkR
=============

2D Random Walk generation implemented in Python, visualization in R

This is my Python implementation of a program that produces a data set of steps in a random walk, 
based on the program included by Dr. Vincent Granville on Data Science Central, which can be
found <a href ="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/2-d-random-walks-simulation-video-with-r-source-code-curious-fact">here</a>.

The R file included is taken directly from the source code on the blog post, and is included for completeness.
